## 03 Python Challenge HW

Each folder (PyBank and PyPoll) includes the main.py python code, a "Resources" folder that includes the csv, and a "Analysis" folder that includes a .txt file of the analysis.

Each python code prints the result into the terminal, while also modifying the associated .txt file to the Analysis folder for later saving. 

Note: This repository does not include all the commits, as I accidentally created the original source file in another repository containing my other homework assignments. See my github for a list of commits.
